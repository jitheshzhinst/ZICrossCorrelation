# ZICrossCorrelation
Cross correlation code for use in devices such as UHFLI and MFLI

UHFLI Cross Correlation code.ipynb is is to be used for a single UHFLI. All the parameters/settings are already parsed and set in the code to the daq handle, so the wiring setup should be the signal output 2 connected into signal input 1 and input 2 via bnc t-splitter. 

Of course, you can use any kind of wiring setup you wish and change the code as you please.
